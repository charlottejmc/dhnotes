(literature, sculpture, film, theater, music, media art, etc.) or topics
related to the intersection of these fields in art and theory. The journal
welcomes essays on international arts and arts movements of any kind,
unrestricted by national, ethnic, religious, or gender borders and boundaries,
and is committed to exploring the full cultural and geographic diversity, as
well as the creative and conceptual rigor, of the contemporary arts.

## H

[**Historical Materialism**](http://www.historicalmaterialism.org/) is a
Marxist journal, appearing four times a year, based in London. Founded in

framework for analysing social phenomena, with an eye to their overhaul. In
our selection of materials, we do not favour any one tendency, tradition or
variant. Marx demanded the ‘merciless criticism of everything that exists’:
for us that includes Marxism itself.

novel, nonfiction narrative, film, and narrative as used in performance  art.

[**New Literary History**](https://muse.jhu.edu/journal/144) focuses on
questions of theory, method, interpretation, and literary history. Rather than

range of scholarly concerns. By examining the bases of criticism, the journal
provokes debate on the relations between literary and cultural texts and

[**Novel**](https://read.dukeupress.edu/novel) is a peer-reviewed journal
devoted to the best new criticism and theory in novel studies. The journal

innovative moments in the field during the half-century that has elapsed since
then—including ideology critique, feminist and critical race theory,
poststructuralism, cultural studies, and new historicism—by publishing the
most interesting new work on the novel. As globalization and crises in
biopolitics and the environment rapidly increase, and as models of affect
theory multiply, the novel and how we read it are undergoing a sea change.
Novel is especially interested in theory and scholarship that address these
changes in terms of their formal, historical, political, and/or
epistemological significance.

[**Philological Encounters**](http://www.brill.com/products/journal/philological-encounters) is
a double-blind peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the historical and philosophical critique of
philology. The journal encourages critical and comparative perspectives that integrate textual
scholarship and the study of language from across the world. Alongside four issues a year,
monographs and/ or collected volumes will occasionally be published as supplements to the
journal. The journal is open to contributions in all fields studying the history of textual
practices, hermeneutics and philology, philological controversies, and the intellectual and
global history of writing, archiving, tradition-making and publishing. Neither confined to any
discipline nor bound by any geographical or temporal limits, Philological Encounters takes as
its point of departure the growing concern with the global significance of philology and the
potential of historically conscious and politically critical philology to challenge exclusivist
notions of the self and the canon.  Philological Encounters welcomes innovative and critical
contributions in the form of articles as well as review articles, usually of two or three
related books, and preferably from different disciplines.

[**Poetics**](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/poetics/#description) is an
interdisciplinary journal of theoretical and  empirical research on culture,

social sciences and around the world, present some of their most innovative
and exciting work in the pages of Public Culture.

## S

[**Sign Systems Studies**](http://www.sss.ut.ee/index.php/sss) was established in 1964 by Juri Lotman (initially as Труды по знаковым системам - Σημειωτικη), and is thus the oldest international semiotic periodical. Originally (until 1992) a Russian-language series, it is now published in English, and has become a central institution in the semiotics of culture.

[**Social Text**](https://read.dukeupress.edu/social-text/pages/About) covers
a broad spectrum of social and cultural phenomena, applying the latest
interpretive methods to the world at large. A daring and controversial leader
in the field of cultural studies, the journal consistently focuses attention
on questions of gender, sexuality, race, and the environment, publishing key
works by the most influential social and cultural theorists. As a journal at
the forefront of cultural theory, Social Text seeks provocative interviews and
challenging articles from emerging critical voices. Each issue breaks new
ground in the debates about postcolonialism, postmodernism, and popular
culture. Columbia's Brent Edwards and Brian Larkin are on the editorial board.

[**Studies in American Fiction**](https://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/studies-american-fiction) publishes reviews and articles on a wide temporal range in American fiction: from neglected and rediscovered early U.S. writers (Susanna Rowson, Leonora Sansay, James Hall) to the emergent authors of the present day (Katherine Dunn, Ana Menéndez, Monique Truong, Toni Morrison).

Engendering conversations about forms of writing that do not succumb to traditional genres, SAF interrogates and redraws both generic and geographic boundaries. SAF is the only journal encompassing American literature from the North American colonial past to the United States' globalized present. Rachel Adams, Walter Benn Michaels,  Louis Menand, Sianne Ngai on the Advisory board.

[**Studies in the Novel**](https://studiesinthenovel.org/) has staked its reputation upon publishing incisive scholarship on the canon-forming and cutting-edge novelists that have shaped the genre’s rich history. The journal continues to break new ground by promoting new theoretical approaches, a broader international scope, and an engagement with the contemporary novel as a form of social critique. The editorial vision of Studies in the Novel is informed by our tradition of showcasing fresh perspectives on canonical authors while extending our founders’ mission to highlight scholarship on novelists from around the globe. As an ongoing scholarly endeavor, Studies in the Novel is committed to the belief that there is more at stake in novelistic inquiry than the study of a literary genre. In its fullest meaning, “novel” represents the study of what is truly novel: “Of a new kind or nature; not previously imagined or thought of” (OED). As a vehicle for critical reflection and social transformation, the novel remains what it always has been: a vital source of new ways of thinking and relating to a rapidly changing world.

[**Style**](http://www.psupress.org/Journals/jnls_Style.html) invites submissions that address questions of style, stylistics, and poetics—as we have traditionally. These submissions may include research and theory in discourse analysis, literary and nonliterary genres, narrative, figuration, metrics, and rhetorical analysis. In addition, Style also now welcomes contributions employing recent developments in several psychologies—cognition, bioevolutionary psychology, family systems, and human development—as those may relate to the study of literature and the humanities. Furthermore, the editors will be pleased to consider submissions on pedagogy generally as such relate to the teaching of literature and the humanities. Contributions may draw from such fields as literary criticism, critical theory, linguistics, philosophy of language, rhetoric, narrative, and composition studies as well as the varieties of psychologies and pedagogies.

[**Substance**](https://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/substance) t is an international nexus for
discourses converging upon literature from a variety of fields, including philosophy, the
social science, science, and the arts. Readers have come to expect the unexpected from
SubStance, and to experience a sense of participating in the formulation of emerging theories.

## T

[**TEXT: An Interdisciplinary Annual of Textual
Studies**](http://www.textual.org/)  endeavors to investigate the meaning and 
implications of textuality is designed to widen our understanding of how  new
developments in fields like codicology, material philology, art  history,
musicology and cultural studies are redefining and integrating  our notions of
what constitutes a text in diverse cultural contexts.

[**Textual
Practice**](http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&journalCode=rtpr20)
is Britain’s principal international journal of radical literary studies, continually pressing
theory into new engagements. Today, as customary relations among disciplines and media are
questioned and transformed, Textual Practice works at the turning points of theory with
politics, history and texts. It is intrigued by the processes through which hitherto marginal
cultures of ethnicity and sexuality are becoming conceptually central, and by the consequences
of these diverse disturbances for educational and cultural institutions.
